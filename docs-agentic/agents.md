## What it is / what it does

RocketRide **agent nodes** let you run an "agent framework" (like LangChain or CrewAI) inside a pipeline. You wire them like any other node: feed them **questions**, get back **answers**, give them access to an LLM and optionally give them access to tools via the invoke lane. Agents operate as tools themselves, wire up an agent as a tool to create a hierarchical agent flow with task delegation. All agents operate the same way within our pipelines, the difference is the underlying framework.

The framework-specific agent nodes are:

- [`agent_langchain`](./langchain.md)
- [`agent_crewai`](./crewai.md)

## When should I use an agent node?

Use an agent node when you want a pipeline step that can:

- Use **Multi-Step Reasoning** to answer a question
- **Sub-Agent delegation** for complex flows where separation of concerns is necessary
- **Tool calling Capability** (if you connect tool providers)
- Use your chosen **LLM provider node**

If you just want "LLM in, answer out" without tool orchestration, a plain `llm_*` node is simpler.

## Inputs and Outputs

Agent nodes use:

| Lane | Direction | What it carries |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| `questions` | in | Questions (from a `chat` source or a `question` node) |
| `answers` | out | Answer text |

## Configuration

### Configuration fields (agent nodes)

Both `agent_crewai` and `agent_langchain` support the same user-facing config field:
- You may add as many "instructions" fields as necessary for your pipeline/use case

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|------|------|---------|------|
| `instructions` | string | `""` | These instruction fields provide extra guidance/steps for the agent's run.|

### Control connections (LLM + tools)

Agent nodes **do not contain API keys** themselves. Instead:

- To let the agent call an LLM, you connect an **LLM node** through invoke.
- To let the agent call tools, you connect one or more **tool provider nodes** through invoke.

## How do I use it? (Step-by-step)

This is the most common "agent chat" pipeline shape:

1. Add a `chat` source.
2. Add an agent node (`agent_langchain` or `agent_crewai`).
3. Connect `chat.questions` → `agent.questions`.
4. Add an LLM node (example: `llm_openai`) and connect the invoke lane to the agent.
5. Add tools nodes (example: MCP_client or HTTP_Request).
6. Add a response node that returns answers (`response_answers`) and connect `agent.answers` → `response.answers`.
7. Run the pipeline and chat.

### Minimal example (`.pipe`)

```json
{
  "project_id": "88ad3ef8-0828-4596-8aea-9df63a89d6f8",
  "source": "chat_1",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "chat_1",
      "provider": "chat",
      "config": { "hideForm": true, "mode": "Source", "type": "chat", "parameters": {} }
    },
    {
      "id": "agent_1",
      "provider": "agent_crewai",
      "config": { "instructions": "Output: \"hello world\"" },
      "input": [{ "lane": "questions", "from": "chat_1" }]
    },
    {
      "id": "llm_openai_1",
      "provider": "llm_openai",
      "config": {
        "profile": "openai-5-2",
        "openai-5-2": { "apikey": "${ROCKETRIDE_OPENAI_KEY}" }
      },
      "control": [{ "classType": "llm", "from": "agent_1" }]
    },
    {
      "id": "response_answers_1",
      "provider": "response_answers",
      "config": { "laneName": "answers" },
      "input": [{ "lane": "answers", "from": "agent_1" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common use cases

- **Tool-using chat assistant**: connect a tool provider (example: `mcp_client`) so the agent can call tools during the conversation.
