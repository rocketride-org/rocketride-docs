## What it is / what it does

`agent_crewai` is an **agent node** powered by **CrewAI**. In a pipeline, it takes in **questions** and produces **answers**, optionally using an LLM and tools you connect to it.

For RocketRide pipeline wiring, lanes, and configuration, see [RocketRide Agents](./agents.md).

## When to use it

Use `agent_crewai` when you want:

- A **CrewAI-based** agent loop

## CrewAI-specific behavior (what this node implements)

This node uses a subset of CrewAI's core concepts:

- **Agent / Task / Crew**: The driver builds a single `Agent`, wraps the user request into a `Task`, and runs a `Crew.kickoff()`.
