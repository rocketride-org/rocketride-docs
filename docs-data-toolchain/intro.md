# Overview

RocketRide is a high-performance data processing engine built on a C++ core with a Python-extensible node system. With 50+ pipeline nodes, native AI/ML support, and SDKs for TypeScript, Python, and MCP, it lets you process, transform, and analyze data at scale — entirely on your own infrastructure.

## Key Capabilities

- **High-performance C++ engine** — Native multithreading purpose-built for throughput, not prototypes.
- **Visual pipeline builder** — Build, debug, test, and scale AI and data workloads from your IDE with an intuitive visual canvas. No browser required.
- **50+ pipeline nodes** — Python-extensible, with 13 LLM providers, 8 vector databases, OCR, NER, PII anonymization, and more.
- **Multi-agent workflows** — Orchestrate and scale agents with built-in support for CrewAI and LangChain.
- **TypeScript, Python & MCP SDKs** — Integrate pipelines into native applications or expose them as tools for AI assistants.
- **One-click deploy** — Run on Docker, on-prem, or RocketRide Cloud.

## Core Concepts

### Pipelines

A pipeline is a directed graph of **nodes** that processes data from input to output. Pipelines are defined as `.pipe` files (JSON format) and rendered visually in the IDE extension. You can run, monitor, and debug pipelines directly from the canvas.

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of every pipeline. Each node performs a specific operation — calling an LLM, embedding text, querying a vector store, transforming data, and more. Nodes are organized into categories by function:

| Category | Nodes | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | 15 | Where data enters the pipeline (webhook, chat, dropper) |
| **LLM** | 13 | Language model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more) |
| **Store** | 9 | Vector database integrations (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, and more) |
| **Text** | 7 | Text analysis and transformation (NER, PII, sentiment, and more) |
| **Agentic** | 4 | Agent framework orchestration (CrewAI, LangChain) |
| **Other** | 4 | Utilities and routing |
| **Embedding** | 3 | Generate vector representations |
| **Image** | 3 | Image processing and OCR |
| **Preprocessor** | 2 | Chunking and code processing |
| **Audio** | 2 | Transcription and playback |
| **Data** | 2 | Document parsing |
| **Infrastructure** | 2 | Output and export |
| **Video** | 1 | Frame extraction |
| **Database** | 1 | Direct database access |

For a full breakdown, see the [Nodes Overview](./nodes-overview.md).

### Lanes

Lanes are the connections between nodes. Each node has typed **input lanes** and **output lanes** that define what data it accepts and produces. You wire nodes together by connecting an output lane of one node to a compatible input lane of another. Some nodes (like agents or LLMs) can also be invoked as **tools** by a parent node.

### Source Types

Every pipeline begins with a **source node** that defines how data enters:
- **Webhook** — Receives data via HTTP requests
- **Chat** — Interactive conversational interface
- **Dropper** — File-based input via drag-and-drop
