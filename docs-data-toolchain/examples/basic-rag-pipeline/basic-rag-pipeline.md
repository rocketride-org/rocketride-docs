  <title>Sample Basic RAG Pipeline - RocketRide Documentation</title>
</head>

This pipeline connects your documents to AI language models, creating a system that answers questions based on your specific information. It works by finding relevant parts of your documents when asked a question, then using those parts to create accurate answers that reflect what's in your files rather than generic knowledge.

## **Pipeline Overview**


This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** using Qdrant as the vector store and LLM (e.g., Gemini).

| **Node** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **RocketRide Sample Data** | Pulls raw files from a Drive or documentation repository |
| **Data Parser** | Extracts plain text from each input file |
| **Preprocessor** | Cleans and splits text into manageable segments (documents) |
| **Embedding Transformer** | Converts documents (and separately, questions) into vector embeddings |
| **Vector Store – Qdrant** | Stores embeddings and metadata; retrieves top-N segments by similarity |
| **LLM – Gemini** | Consumes retrieved context + question to generate a context-aware answer |
| **HTTP Results** | Returns the generated response back to the chat UI or API endpoint |

## **Workflow Breakdown:**

### **1\. Data Source Node**

This node pulls your source files (e.g., Google Drive, S3, local docs).

#### **How it works**

- (e.g. Google Drive)
    1. You click ▶️ on the RocketRide Sample Data node.
    2. It fetches files from the configured drive path.

### **2\. Data Parser Node**

In this node, we extract the content from the files. In this scenario, we are extracting text.

#### **How it works**

- Receives "Data" from the Sample Data node.
- Splits into multiple channels: Text, Table, Image, Audio, Video.

### **3\. Preprocessor - General Text**

This node splits large text blocks into smaller "documents" ready for embedding. Here, we’ll take the large text segments and split them up into documents that can be embedded.

#### **How it works**

- Takes parser output, applies sanitization, chunking, and metadata tagging.
- Emits a stream of document objects.

### **Configuration:**

- It ensures that our documents are split into well-sized, context-preserving segments, optimizing them for embedding and retrieval in your RAG pipeline.
    
    | **Setting** | **Value/Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Text Splitter | Default Text Splitter | Balances structure and size for general-purpose use |
    | Split by | String length | Splits text based on character count |
    | String Length | 512 | Each segment is up to 512 characters long |
    
    #### **Text Splitter**
    

### **4\. Embedding - Transformer**

The **Embedding - Sentence Transformer** node is responsible for converting text (such as document segments or user questions) into vector embeddings, which are essential for semantic search and retrieval in a RAG pipeline. 

### **How it works**

- **Documents transformer:** turns each text chunk into a vector.

### **Configuration:**

#### **Available Options:**

- **Custom model:** Use your own pre-trained or fine-tuned model.
- **miniAll:** A general-purpose model, suitable for a variety of tasks.
- **miniLM:** Optimized for general use, offering a good balance between performance and speed.
- **mpnet:** Another high-quality model, often providing strong results on semantic similarity tasks.


### **5\. Vector Store (Qdrant) Node**

The **Qdrant Vector Store node** is critical in a RAG pipeline. It is responsible for storing and retrieving vector embeddings, enabling efficient semantic search and context retrieval for downstream language models.

#### **How it works**

- 1. Ingests document embeddings + metadata.
    2. On query, computes similarity between the question vector and stored vectors.
    3. Returns top-K relevant document segments.

### **Configuration:**

 
| **Field** | **Example Value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type of Qdrant host | Your own Qdrant server | Specifies the Qdrant deployment (local, cloud, or custom server). |
| Host | localhost | The server address where Qdrant is running. |
| Port | 6333 | The port number Qdrant listens on (default: 6333). |
| Retrieval Score | Related | Sets the minimum similarity score for retrieving relevant vectors. |
| Collection | APARAVI | The name of the Qdrant collection used to store and query vectors. |

### **6\. LLM – Gemini Node**

Generates an answer using the retrieved context and the original question. Here, it sends the question over to the **LLM** along with the context retrieved from the vector store. **How it works**

- **Inputs:** "Questions" (text prompt) + "Documents" (retrieved context).
- **Outputs:** "Answers" the LLM's text response.

#### **Available Models**

- Anthropic
- Amazon Bedrock
- OpenAI
- Gemini
- Llama
- XAI
- Ollama
- VertexAI
- DeepSeek

### **Configuration:**

- Here's where you can find your [Gemini API key.](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key.) Remember to store your API key securely and never share it publicly.

#### **Gemini Config**


### **7\. HTTP Results Node**

- Receives the generated answer from the LLM node.
- Forward it to the chat UI, API endpoint, or any connected service.

#### **How it works**

- Receives "Answers" from the Gemini node.
- Sends them back over HTTP to complete the loop.

## **Basic RAG Chat Pipeline:**

This is a simplified RAG pipeline focused on chat interactions, using Qdrant as the vector store and Gemini LLM.

 
| **Node** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **Chat Input** | Receives user questions and chat history |
| **Embedding Transformer** | Converts user questions into vector embeddings |
| **Vector Store – Qdrant** | Retrieves relevant document segments by semantic similarity |
| **HTTP Result** | Returns retrieved documents and question to front-end or next pipeline stage |

## **Workflow Breakdown B:**

### **1\. Chat Input Node**

Captures user queries and maintains conversation context.

#### **How it works**

- Receives user questions from the chat interface.
- Formats the question for vector embedding.

### **2\. Embedding Transformer**

Converts the user question into a vector embedding for semantic search.

#### **How it works**

- Receives a formatted question from the Chat Input node.
- Transforms text into a vector representation using the same model used for document embedding.

### **3\. Vector Store (Qdrant) Node**

Searches previously stored document embeddings for semantically similar content.


#### **How it works**

- Compares the question embedding against stored document embeddings.
- Retrieves the top-K most relevant document segments based on similarity scores.
- Returns both the original texts and their relevance scores.

### **4\. LLM – Gemini Node**

#### **How it works**

- **Inputs:** "Questions" (text prompt) + "Documents" (retrieved context).
- **Outputs:** "Answers" the LLM's text response.

#### **Available Models:**

- - Anthropic
    - Amazon Bedrock
    - OpenAI
    - Gemini
    - Llama
    - XAI
    - Ollama
    - VertexAI
    - DeepSeek

### **Configuration:**

- Here's where you can find your [Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key). Remember to store your API key securely and never share it publicly.

#### Gemini Config


### **5\. HTTP Result Node**

Returns the retrieved context to the interface or to a downstream LLM.

#### **How it works**

- Packages the original question and retrieved contexts.
- Sends response back to the chat interface or another pipeline for LLM processing.
