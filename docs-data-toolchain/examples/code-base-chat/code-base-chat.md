## **Pipeline**


### **Pipeline Components**

#### 🌐 Web Hook

Receives uploaded code files via HTTP

#### 📄 Data - Parser

Extracts structured text from uploaded files

#### 🔧 Preprocessor - Code

Parses and tokenizes source code

#### 🧠 Embedding - Sentence Transformer

Converts code chunks to vector embeddings

#### 📊 Vector Store - Qdrant

Stores and indexes code embeddings for semantic search

* * *

## **Detailed Component Configuration**

#### **1\. Web Hook**

Purpose: Receives uploaded code files through HTTP requests

Configuration:

- Method: PUT
- Query Parameters: `type`, `token`
- Headers:
    - `Content-Type`: Automatically set based on file type
    - `Authorization`: Your API key (found in the webhook URL)
- Body: File upload (supports various code file formats)

Response: JSON containing processed objects with embedded code chunks

#### **2\. Data - Parser**

Purpose: Extracts structured text, tables, or other relevant information from uploaded files for downstream processing

Description: The data parser node processes uploaded files and converts them into a format that can be consumed by the code preprocessor. It handles various file formats and extracts the raw text content needed for code analysis.

#### **3\. Preprocessor - Code**

Purpose: Parses and tokenizes source code, extracting functions, classes, and comments to prepare code for analysis, embedding, or search

#### **Configuration Options**

| Setting | Default | Options | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Code Splitter Profile | Auto | Auto, C/C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript | Determines parsing rules and syntax highlighting |
| Maximum String Length | 512 | Configurable character limit | Controls chunk size for downstream processing |

#### **Supported Languages**

- Auto: Automatic language detection based on file extension
- C/C++: C and C++ source code
- Python: Python source code
- JavaScript: JavaScript source code
- TypeScript: TypeScript source code

#### **4\. Embedding - Sentence Transformer**

Purpose: Converts text into high-dimensional vector embeddings using advanced transformer models

Configuration:

- Model (Default: miniLM): Determines embedding quality, speed, and domain specialization

#### **Available Models**

| Model | Full Name | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| miniLM | `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1` | General use embeddings, good performance |
| miniAll | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | High-quality general purpose |
| mpnet | `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-cos-v1` | Excellent quality, slower processing |
| Custom | Any Hugging Face model | Specialized requirements |

#### **5\. Vector Store - Qdrant**

Purpose: Stores and retrieves vector embeddings for similarity search

#### **Host Configuration**

| Type | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | Self-hosted Qdrant server | Development, private deployment |
| Cloud | Qdrant Cloud instance | Production, managed service |

#### **Local Qdrant Parameters**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | localhost | Your local Qdrant server hostname |
| Port | 6333 | Qdrant server port number |
| Collection | APARAVI | Vector collection name |

#### **Qdrant Cloud Parameters**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | \- | Cloud instance URL (e.g., `<instance>.<region>.qdrant.io`) |
| Port | 443 | HTTPS port for cloud connections |
| API Key | Required | Authentication key for cloud access |
| Collection | APARAVI | Cloud collection name |

## **Pipeline Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Create the Pipeline**

#### **Start with Web Hook**

Add the Web Hook node as your source

#### **Add Data Parser**

Connect Web Hook's Data output to Data-Parser

#### **Add Code Preprocessor**

Connect Web Hook's Text output to Preprocessor-Code

#### **Connect Parser to Preprocessor**

Link Data-Parser output to Preprocessor-Code

#### **Add Embedding**

Connect Preprocessor-Code to Embedding-Transformer

#### **Add Vector Store**

Connect Embedding-Transformer to Qdrant

### **Step 2: Configure Components**

#### **Preprocessor - Code Configuration**

- Code Splitter Profile: Choose "Auto" for automatic language detection
- Maximum String Length: Set to 512 (or adjust based on your needs)

#### **Embedding Configuration**

- Model: Select "miniLM" for general-purpose code embedding
- Alternative: Use "mpnet" for higher quality embeddings

#### **Qdrant Configuration**

For Cloud Setup:

- Set Type to "Cloud"
- Enter your Qdrant Cloud host URL
- Provide your API key
- Use default collection name "APARAVI"

### **Step 3: Run and Test**

1. Start the Pipeline: Run your configured pipeline
2. Get Webhook URL: Copy the webhook URL from the Project Log
3. Test with Talend API Tester:
    - Method: PUT
    - URL: Your webhook URL
    - Query Parameters: Add `type` and `token`
    - Headers: `Content-Type` (auto-set), `Authorization` (your API key)
    - Body: Upload a code file
4. Verify Success: Look for "200 OK" response
5. Check Qdrant: View code chunks as points in your vector store

* * *

## **How to Use the Pipeline**

#### **Prepare Your Code Files**

Ensure your code files have proper extensions for language detection:

- `.py` for Python
- `.js` for JavaScript
- `.ts` for TypeScript
- `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h` for C/C++

#### **Upload via API**

Use the webhook URL to upload your code files. The system will:

- Parse the uploaded file
- Detect the programming language
- Extract functions, classes, and comments
- Create vector embeddings
- Store in Qdrant for search

#### **Query Your Codebase**

Once processed, you can search your code using:

- Semantic search queries
- Function descriptions
- Code patterns
- Natural language questions

* * *

## **Use Cases**

#### **🔍 Code Search and Discovery**

- Semantic Code Search: Find code by meaning, not just keywords
- Function Discovery: Locate similar functions across codebase
- Pattern Recognition: Identify common coding patterns

#### **📚 Code Analysis and Documentation**

- Code Summarization: Generate summaries of code functions
- Documentation Generation: Auto-generate code documentation
- Code Review Assistance: Identify potential issues or improvements

#### **🤖 AI-Powered Development**

- Code Completion: Build intelligent code completion systems
- Refactoring Suggestions: Identify code that could be improved
- Knowledge Base: Create searchable code knowledge bases

* * *

## **Best Practices**

### **Code Preprocessing**

- Language Detection: Use "Auto" for mixed-language codebases
- Chunk Size: Balance between 256-1024 characters for optimal embedding
- File Types: Support all major programming languages

### **Embedding Selection**

- miniLM: Best for general-purpose code embedding
- mpnet: Use for higher quality when processing time allows
- Custom Models: Consider domain-specific models for specialized code

### **Vector Store Management**

- Collection Organization: Use separate collections for different projects
- Score Thresholds: Start with 0.7-0.8 for strict matching
- Regular Updates: Re-index codebase after significant changes

* * *

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

- Language Detection: Ensure file extensions match expected languages
- Chunk Size: Adjust maximum string length if chunks are too large/small
- Qdrant Connection: Verify host, port, and API key for cloud instances
- Embedding Quality: Try different models if search results are poor

### **Performance Optimization**

- Batch Processing: Process multiple files in sequence
- Model Selection: Choose faster models for large codebases
- Vector Storage: Use cloud Qdrant for better scalability

* * *

## **Advanced Features**
