## **What does it do?**

The FireCrawl source scans a website and emits HTML content for downstream processing. It calls the FireCrawl service to scrape a URL, optionally inlines images, and writes metadata and data to the pipeline. This node is ideal for ingesting website pages as HTML for indexing, classification, OCR, or vectorization tasks.

## **How d****o I****use it?**

### **Add the FireCrawl Web Crawler**

- Insert the source node at the beginning of your pipeline
- Configure the target URL and API credentials
- Set up include/exclude patterns to scope the crawling
- Connect the output to downstream processing components

### **Configure Parameters**

The FireCrawl node requires these configuration parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `firecrawl.url` | Site or page URL to scrape | Yes |
| `firecrawl.apikey` | FireCrawl API key (stored securely) | Yes |
| `firecrawl.embed_images` | Embed images inline into HTML (default: false) | No |
| `include/exclude` | Path filters to scope crawling | No |

For more information on how to get the parameters, please look at the [FireCrawl Docs](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction).

### **Connect Output**

- Connect the **HTML** output lane to downstream components
- Each scraped page will be emitted as HTML content with metadata
- Output format is consistent for reliable downstream processing

## **Con****fig****uration****Pipeline**


The FireCrawl node follows a structured configuration approach:

#### **1\. URL Configuration**

**Action**: Set the target website or page URL

**Purpose**: Defines the starting point for web scraping

**Example**: `https://example.com/docs/`

#### **2\. Authentication Setup**

**Action**: Configure FireCrawl API key

**Purpose**: Provides access to the FireCrawl scraping service

**Format**: `fc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### **3\. Content Options**

**Action**: Set image embedding preferences

**Purpose**: Controls whether images are inlined into HTML

**Effect**: Increases payload size but ensures complete content capture

#### **4\. Scope Filtering**

**Action**: Define include/exclude patterns

**Purpose**: Limits crawling to specific site sections

**Examples**: `docs/*`, `blog/*`, `!private/*`

* * *

## **Example Use Cases**

#### **Documentation Indexing**

**Scenario**: Building a searchable index of company documentation

**Solution**: Crawl documentation sites and feed content to search indexing

**Result**: Comprehensive searchable knowledge base from web content

#### **Content Classification**

**Scenario**: Automatically categorizing web pages by content type

**Solution**: Scrape pages and process through ML classification models

**Result**: Automated content taxonomy and organization

#### **Data Migration**

**Scenario**: Migrating content from legacy websites

**Solution**: Systematically crawl and extract structured content

**Result**: Automated content migration with preserved structure

#### **Competitive Analysis**

**Scenario**: Monitoring competitor websites for changes

**Solution**: Regular crawling to track content updates and changes

**Result**: Automated competitive intelligence gathering

* * *

## **Best Practices**

### **For Optimal Results**

- Use specific include/exclude patterns to limit scope and improve performance
- Test with a small URL set before scaling to full site crawling
- Monitor API usage limits and adjust crawling frequency accordingly
- Consider image embedding only when necessary due to increased payload size

### **Pipeline Integration**

- Place FireCrawl at the beginning of your pipeline as a source
- Connect to text extraction, classification, or indexing components
- Use transformation components to clean or structure the HTML content
- Consider rate limiting for large-scale crawling operations

### **Performance Considerations**

- Crawling speed depends on target site responsiveness and API limits
- Use path filters to avoid crawling unnecessary content
- Monitor bandwidth usage, especially with image embedding enabled
- Implement error handling for unreliable target websites

* * *

## **Technical Details**

### **Behavior and Flow**

1. **stat**: Tries a scrape to check reachability; returns False if OK (exists), True otherwise
2. **checkChanged**: Forces a render by setting a fake size
3. **render**: Scrapes via FireCrawl, validates success, optionallyembeds images, sends metadata and HTML to pipeline

### **What it emits**

#### **Lane: `tags`**

#### **Metadata (per object):**

- `url`: full page URL
- `path`: path used to build the URL
- `name`: object name
- `size`: length of HTML content (bytes)

#### **Data:**

HTML (with images optionally embedded)

### **Supported Actions**

- `export` - Extract and process content
- `download` - Retrieve and store content locally

* * *

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

- **401/403/Invalid key**: Ensure `firecrawl.apikey` is correct and has sufficient permissions
- **500 "All scraping engines failed"**: Double-check `firecrawl.url`, try again later, or contact FireCrawl support if persistent
- **Empty/Unexpected HTML**: Check for redirects and site behavior; consider disabling image embedding to reduce payload size
- **Network timeout**: Verify network access from Engine host to FireCrawl API and target site

### **Performance Issues**

- Large sites may exceed API rate limits - implement appropriate delays
- Image embedding significantly increases processing time and bandwidth
- Complex include/exclude patterns may slow down filtering
- Some servers return 200 for missing pages (redirects) - content is still emitted as returned

### **Error Handling**

- Non-success or non-200 status raises errors like "Failed to scrape URL..."
- Invalid URLs or unreachable sites will cause pipeline failures
- API key issues result in authentication errors

* * *

## **Expected Results**

After using the FireCrawl Web Crawler in your pipeline:

1. **Structured HTML Content**: Clean, processable HTML from target websites
2. **Comprehensive Metadata**: URL, path, name, and size information for each page
3. **Consistent Format**: Standardized output suitable for downstream processing
4. **Scalable Extraction**: Efficient crawling of single pages or entire site sections
5. **Reliable Content Capture**: Professional-grade scraping with optional image embedding
