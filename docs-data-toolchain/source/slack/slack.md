## **Configuration**

- Authentication Type - Select whether to connect through a corporate-managed Slack bot or a personal Slack account.
    - Service - use a service account to access slack data through the RocketRide slack app bot
    - Personal - use a personal account to access slack data through a user token
- Steps to Connect:
    - Click "**Connect to Slack**"
    - When prompted by Slack, click **“Allow”** to grant RocketRide permission to access your workspace.
- Conversation Filtering (optional)
    - You can control which Slack conversations are ingested by including or excluding specific channels or DMs.
    - **Include Conversations**: Only the listed conversations will be ingested. By default, all conversations the user or bot has access to will be included
    - **Exclude Conversations**: The listed conversations will be skipped. By default, no conversations are excluded.
    - **Finding IDs**: To locate a channel or conversation ID, right-click on the channel or DM, select **View details**, and copy the ID at the bottom. For DMs, you must use the ID (since they do not have names). For channels, you can use either the channel name or the channel ID.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### Service vs. Personal Token Access

- **Service**: Service accounts can only read messages from channels they have explicitly invited the RocketRide bot to. Service accounts cannot access direct messages (DMs)
- **Personal**: A user token allows access to all channels and DMs that the user is a member of. This includes direct messages and group conversations, but only those the user participates in.
