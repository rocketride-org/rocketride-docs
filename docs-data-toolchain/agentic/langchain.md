## What it is / what it does

`agent_langchain` is an **agent node** powered by **LangChain**. In a pipeline, it takes in **questions** and produces **answers**, optionally using an LLM and tools you connect to it.

For RocketRide pipeline wiring, lanes, and configuration, see [RocketRide Agents](./agents.md).

## When to use it

Use `agent_langchain` when you want:

- A **LangChain-based** agent loop
- Tool access (if you connect tool providers)
- A node that works well in "tool calling" setups

## LangChain-specific behavior (what this node implements)

This node uses a small subset of LangChain's agent/tool concepts:

- **Agent runtime**: The driver uses LangChain's `create_agent(...)` and invokes the agent with the user prompt.
