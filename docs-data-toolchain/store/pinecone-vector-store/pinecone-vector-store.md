The Pinecone Vector Store node connects your pipeline to a Pinecone index, enabling high-speed vector search capabilities. It stores and retrieves document embeddings and matches them against queries using vector similarity.


### Inputs

- Documents - Receives vectorized documents to be stored in the Pinecone collection.
- Questions - Accepts vectorized queries for searching similar embeddings in Pinecone.

### Outputs

- Answers - Returns the best-matching vectors or metadata based on the retrieval score.
- Documents - Emits document information retrieved from Pinecone for further use.
- Questions - Forwards the incoming query vector downstream (e.g., into LLMs or logs).

### Configuration Steps

- Type of Pinecone Connection - Choose your Pinecone connection method
    - Example - Pinecone Pod-Based Index
- API Key - Enter your Pinecone API key
- Retrieval Score - Select the minimum similarity threshold for result relevance
    - Example - Related
- Collection - Specify the name of the Pinecone collection (index)
    - Rules - lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens allowed
    - Example - rocketride
