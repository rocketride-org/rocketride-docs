The **Astra DB Vector Store node** (`astra_db`) connects your pipeline to DataStax Astra DB for vector storage and semantic search. It supports both lexical (BM25) and vector-based retrieval, making it suitable for RAG workflows that need hybrid search capabilities.

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `collection` | string | Yes | — | Collection name (alphanumeric and underscores, must start with a letter or digit) |
| `api_endpoint` | string | Yes | — | Astra DB Data API endpoint URL |
| `application_token` | string | No | — | Authentication token |
| `similarity` | string | No | `cosine` | Vector similarity metric: `cosine`, `euclidean`, or `dot_product` |

## Inputs and Outputs

### Input Channels

- **Questions** (`writeQuestions`) — Question objects for semantic or keyword search against the collection.
- **Documents** (`writeDocuments`) — Document objects with embeddings for ingestion into the vector store.
- **Render Object** (`renderObject`) — Retrieve and stream complete documents by ID.

### Output Channels

- **Documents** — Search results returned as document objects with similarity scores.
- **Text** — Rendered document content retrieved via the render object channel.

## Key Details

- Built on the Astra DB Data API using the `astrapy` package.
- Supports dual search modes: **lexical** (BM25) and **semantic** (vector similarity).
- Automatically configures lexical indexes with a standard analyzer.
- Collections are created with both vector and lexical index support.
- Documents are ingested in batches of 500 with automatic flush.
- Zero-magnitude vectors are rejected during ingestion.
- Filters on `nodeId`, `parent`, `permissions`, `isDeleted`, and `chunkId` ranges.

## Common Use Cases

- **RAG pipelines** — Store embeddings and retrieve relevant context for LLM-powered question answering.
- **Hybrid search** — Combine keyword and semantic search for more accurate retrieval.
- **Serverless vector storage** — Use Astra DB's serverless infrastructure without managing database clusters.
