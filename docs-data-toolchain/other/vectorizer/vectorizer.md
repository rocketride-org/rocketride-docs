The **Vectorizer node** (`vectorizer`) is an orchestration node that combines text preprocessing, embedding generation, and vector storage into a single step. Instead of wiring separate preprocessor, embedding, and store nodes, you can configure all three within the Vectorizer to simplify your pipeline.

## Configuration

The Vectorizer wraps three sub-configurations:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `preprocessor` | nested config | No | Text preprocessing service configuration |
| `embedding` | nested config | No | Embedding model service configuration |
| `store` | nested config | No | Vector store backend configuration |

Each nested config follows the same schema as its standalone node counterpart. For example, the `embedding` config accepts the same fields as whichever embedding node you select (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.).

## Inputs and Outputs

### Input Channels

- **Text** (`writeText`) — Raw text to preprocess, embed, and store.
- **Table** (`writeTable`) — Table data to vectorize.

### Output Channels

- **Documents** (`writeDocuments`) — Document objects with embeddings and metadata (in transform mode).

## Execution Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Instance** | Preprocesses text, generates embeddings, and writes directly to the configured vector store. |
| **Transform** | Preprocesses text and generates embeddings, then outputs document objects via `writeDocuments` for downstream nodes to handle storage. |

## Key Details

- Chains preprocessing → embedding → optional storage in a single node.
- Text is chunked by the configured preprocessor before embedding.
- Each chunk gets metadata: `chunkId`, `tableId`, `isTable`, `isDeleted`, `permissionId`.
- Respects the `VECTORIZE` flag on source objects to control which content is vectorized.
- Supports document rendering via callback (retrieves stored documents).
- Multi-provider support — you can mix and match preprocessor, embedding, and store backends.

## Common Use Cases

- **Simplified RAG ingestion** — Preprocess, embed, and store documents in one node instead of three.
- **Pipeline prototyping** — Quickly set up a vectorization pipeline without wiring multiple nodes.
- **Batch document processing** — Ingest large document sets with built-in chunking and embedding.
