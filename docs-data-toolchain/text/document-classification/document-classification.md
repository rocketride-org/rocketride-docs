This node enables policy-based classification of textual input according to predefined privacy, compliance, or national security categories. It supports multiple classification contexts, including country-specific policies. 


Inputs

- Documents - Document objects to be classified
- Text - Raw or preprocessed text to be classified

### Outputs

- Documents - Document objects with classification metadata added
- Categories - Classification results as category objects
- ClassificationContext - Metadata describing the classification environment or policy scope (example - U.S. Privacy, Germany Data Act)
- Classifications - Detected classification labels matching the input policies (example - SSN, Passport, Sensitive Data)
- Text - Outputs plain text or extracted textual content from documents

### Configuration

#### GUI

1. **Select applicable classification policies**  
   The classification interface is organized into three sections:
   - **Selected Classifications** - Displays all currently selected policies that will be applied
   - **Custom Classifications** - Displays classifications that you have custom built 
   - **Predefined Classifications** - Pre-built, production-ready policies organized by country and domain
   
2. **Create custom classifications (optional)**  
   Expand the Custom Classifications section and click the **Create** button to define classification rules specific to your use case.
   
3. **Select predefined classifications**  
   Predefined classifications provide compliance-ready policies that cover common regulatory and privacy frameworks. These save time and reduce errors by offering:
   - Country-specific regulations (e.g., United States Sensitive Data Policy for HIPAA, SSN, financial data)
   - Domain-specific standards (e.g., PII detection, financial data, healthcare records)
   - Regular updates to reflect changing compliance requirements
   
   To apply predefined classifications:
   - Expand each country or domain section
   - Check individual policies you want applied to the input
   - Examples:
     - United States > Social Security Number (SSN) and Taxpayer ID Policy
     - Germany > Data Protection Act Classifications
     
4. **Configure output filtering**  
   **Note:** This filtering option only applies to the Text input/output lane and requires both the Text input and Text output connections to be active.
   
   At the bottom of the configuration panel, choose how to filter the text output:
   - **Match Selected Classifications** - Return only text that matches the selected classification policies
   - **Don't Match Selected Classifications** - Return only text that does NOT match the selected policies
   - **Return All Text** - Return all text regardless of classification matches

5. **Review and confirm selections**  
   Verify your selected classifications before proceeding to ensure proper coverage.

##### Note

- All selected policies will be used as context for the classification engine.
- Ensure you only enable policies relevant to your regulatory or operational domain.

Classification Model

- Model Type - Type of classification model
    - Default - "ml"
    - Options - ml, rules, hybrid
- Predefined Model - Use a predefined classification model
    - Default - null
    - Notes - Available predefined models
- Custom Model Path - Path to custom model file
    - Default - null
    - Notes - For user-trained models

#### Classification Categories

- Categories - List of classification categories
    - Default - \[\]
    - Notes - Required for rule-based classification
- Hierarchical - Enable hierarchical classification
    - Default - false
    - Notes - For nested category structures
- Multi-label - Allow multiple categories per document
    - Default - false
    - Notes - For non-exclusive categorization

#### Advanced Settings

- Confidence Threshold - Minimum confidence score
    - Default - 0.7
    - Notes - Higher values increase precision
- Feature Extraction - Text feature extraction method
    - Default - "tfidf"
    - Options - tfidf, embeddings, custom
- Max Categories - Maximum categories per document
    - Default - 3
    - Notes - Only applies when multi-label is true

### Example Usage

### Basic Document Categorization

This example shows how to configure the Document Classification for basic categorization: `{ "modelType": "ml", "predefinedModel": "general-document-classifier", "confidenceThreshold": 0.7, "multiLabel": false }`

#### Custom Classification Rules

For rule-based classification with custom categories: `{ "modelType": "rules", "categories": [ { "name": "Financial","rules": [ {"type": "keyword", "terms": ["invoice", "payment", "transaction", "bank"]},{"type": "regex", "pattern": "\\$\\d+([.,]\\d{2})"} ] },{ "name": "Legal","rules": [ {"type": "keyword", "terms": ["contract", "agreement", "legal", "law"]},{"type": "regex", "pattern": "section \\d+\\.\\d+"} ] },{ "name": "Technical","rules": [ {"type": "keyword", "terms": ["software", "hardware", "system", "code"]},{"type": "regex", "pattern": "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\("} ] } ], "hierarchical": false, "multiLabel": true, "maxCategories": 2, "confidenceThreshold": 0.6 }`

## Example

- Input Text - “John Doe, SSN: 123-45-6789, lives in California.”
- ClassificationContext - United States
- Classifications - SSN, Personal Data

### Best Practices

#### Model Selection

- Use predefined models for common classification tasks
- Train custom models for domain-specific categorization
- Consider rule-based classification for transparent, explainable results
- Use hybrid approach for complex classification needs

#### Performance Optimization

- Adjust confidence threshold based on precision vs. recall requirements
- Use hierarchical classification for large category sets
- Limit max categories in multi-label mode to improve precision
- Preprocess documents to remove noise that might affect classification

### Troubleshooting

#### Classification Problems

- Low accuracy - Train on more domain-specific data or adjust confidence threshold
- Misclassifications - Review and refine rules or model training data
- No classifications - Check if confidence threshold is too high

#### Performance Issues

- Slow processing - Use a simpler model or feature extraction method
- Memory errors - Process documents in smaller batches
