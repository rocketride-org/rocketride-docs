The Dictionary node enables lookups, tagging, or transformations using a predefined dictionary structure. It can operate over documents, questions, or general text, and emit structured outputs to be used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), classification, or enrichment pipelines.


### Inputs

- Documents - Optional supporting documents for context or reference
- Text- Raw or structured text to process through the dictionary
- Questions/Term - Optional list of user queries for contextual matching or enrichment

### Outputs

- Definitions - Generated term definitions
- Documents - Documents with annotations or tags resulting from dictionary matches
- Answers - Structured answers or matches from the dictionary
- Questions - Processed or enriched questions that may include mapped terms or synonyms

### Configuration

#### Term Extraction

- Extraction Method - Method to identify terms
    - Default - "auto"
    - Options - auto, regex, nlp, predefined
- Max Terms - Maximum terms to extract per document
    - Default - 20
    - Notes - Limits processing time
- Min Term Length - Minimum character length for terms
    - Default - 3
    - Notes - Filters out short terms
- Term Filters - Filters to apply to extracted terms
    - Default - \[\]
    - Examples - POS tags, frequency thresholds

#### Definition Generation

- Definition Source - Source for definitions
    - Default - "context"
    - Options - context, llm, dictionary, custom
- LLM Provider - LLM provider for definitions
    - Default - null
    - Notes - Required if definition source is "llm"
- Context Window - Number of characters around term for context
    - Default - 500
    - Notes - For context-based definitions
- Definition Length - Target character length for definitions
    - Default - 200
    - Notes - Approximate length guidance

#### Advanced Settings

- Deduplication - Remove duplicate terms
    - Default - true
    - Notes - Across all processed documents
- Custom Dictionary - Path to custom dictionary file
    - Default - null
    - Notes - For custom definition sources
- Term Grouping - Group related terms
    - Default - false
    - Notes - Creates term hierarchies

### Example Usage

### Basic Term Extraction and Definition

This example shows how to configure the Definitions component for basic term extraction and definition:

`{ "extractionMethod": "nlp", "maxTerms": 15, "minTermLength": 4, "definitionSource": "context", "contextWindow": 600, "definitionLength": 150, "deduplication": true }`

#### LLM-Powered Technical Glossary

For creating a technical glossary using an LLM:

`{ "extractionMethod": "nlp", "maxTerms": 30, "minTermLength": 3, "termFilters": [ {"type": "pos", "tags": ["NOUN", "PROPN"]}, {"type": "frequency", "minOccurrences": 2} ], "definitionSource": "llm", "llmProvider": { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.3, "prompt": "Define the following technical term in 1-2 sentences: {term}" }, "definitionLength": 200, "deduplication": true, "termGrouping": true }`

### Example

- Input - “Our infrastructure uses Kubernetes and S3.”
- Dictionary - `{"Kubernetes": "cloud-native orchestrator", "S3": "Amazon object storage"}`
- Output
    - Answers - Definitions for matched terms
    - Documents - Original text with terms tagged or explained
    - Questions - May be rephrased with definitions added for clarity

### Best Practices

#### Term Extraction

- Use NLP-based extraction for technical documents
- Use regex for documents with predictable term patterns
- Apply appropriate filters to reduce noise in extracted terms
- Consider domain-specific term extraction rules

#### Definition Generation

- Use context-based definitions when document contains explanations
- Use LLM-based definitions for technical or specialized terminology
- Provide custom dictionaries for domain-specific terminology
- Adjust context window size based on document structure
- Ensure Dictionary is Configured (Not shown in this screenshot)
- If a UI or configuration file for dictionary terms exists, populate or validate the terms being matched.
- Dictionaries typically consist of key-value pairs, synonyms, or tagged patterns.
- Connect Answers to a downstream QA or retrieval system.
- Connect Documents to a storage or annotation step.
- Connect Questions to LLM or search nodes to enrich prompt quality

### Troubleshooting

#### Extraction Problems

- Too many irrelevant terms - Adjust term filters or increase min term length
- Missing important terms - Try different extraction methods or reduce filters
- Duplicate terms with variations - Enable term grouping

#### Definition Problems

- Definitions too generic - Use domain-specific LLM prompts or custom dictionaries
- Definitions missing context - Increase context window size
- Inconsistent definition quality - Try different definition sources
