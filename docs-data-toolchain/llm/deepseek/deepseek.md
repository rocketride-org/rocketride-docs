The **Deepseek node** connects to Deepseek's large language models for processing natural language prompts and generating responses. It integrates LLM functionality into your workflow through token-based API authentication. This node is typically used for tasks such as text generation, code creation, reasoning, and conversational AI.


## **Inputs and Outputs**

- #### **Input Channels**
    

**Prompt** – Primary text input for the model **Questions** – Accepts plain text prompts or user-generated questions **Documents** – Document objects for context **System** – System instructions for the model

- #### **Output Channels**
    

**Text** – Generated text output **Answers** – Model-generated response that can be passed to other nodes

## **Configuration:**

- **Model** – Deepseek model to use Default – "deepseek-chat" (Primary models include deepseek-chat and deepseek-coder)
- **API Key** – Deepseek API key required for authentication
