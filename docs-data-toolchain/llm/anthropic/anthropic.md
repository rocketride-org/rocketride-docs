The **Anthropic node** integrates Anthropic's Claude large language models into your workflow. It accepts input prompts, processes them using a selected Claude model, and returns generated answers. This node is typically used for tasks such as reasoning, summarization, content generation, and conversational response.


## **Configuration:**

When setting up the Anthropic node, you'll need to configure several parameters:

- **Model Selection:** Choose the appropriate Claude model variant based on your needs (e.g., claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-haiku).
- **API Key:** Enter your Anthropic API key for authentication. Remember to store your API key securely and never share it publicly.
- **Available Models:** The Anthropic node provides access to Claude's latest models, ensuring you can leverage advanced AI capabilities for your workflows.
    

## **Supported Model Variants:**

| **Model** | **Input Tokens** | **Optimized For** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | 200K | High-speed responses, efficiency, lightweight applications |
| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | 200K | Balanced performance, general-purpose use, improved reasoning |
| Custom Model | User-specified | Specialized use cases, upcoming Claude models |

### **Key capabilities include:**

- Advanced natural language understanding and generation
- Nuanced reasoning with complex concepts
- Content summarization and transformation
- Conversational AI with strong safety features
- Multi-turn dialogue management

### **Inputs and Outputs**

- #### **Input Channels:**
    

**Prompt** – Primary text input for the model. **Questions** – Accepts plain text prompts or user-generated questions, forwarded to the Claude model for processing. **Documents** – Document objects for context. **System** – System instructions for the model.

- #### **Output Channels:**
    

**Text** – Generated text output. **Answers** – The model-generated response based on the input received. The output is a string of generated text that can be passed to other nodes.
