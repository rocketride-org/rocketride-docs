The **OpenAI node** connects to OpenAI’s hosted large language models. It accepts input prompts, processes them using a selected model, and returns generated answers. This node is typically used for tasks such as reasoning, summarization, content generation, and conversational response.


## **Configuration:**

When setting up the openAI node, you'll need to configure several parameters:

- **Model** - AI model to use (Default: "gpt-4"). Selects which OpenAI model will process your requests. Different models offer varying capabilities, context lengths, and price points. GPT-4o provides the best balance of performance and efficiency for most tasks.
- **API Key** - Required: OpenAI API key for authentication. This secure credential grants access to OpenAI's API services. You can generate or manage keys through your OpenAI account dashboard.
- **Max Tokens** - Maximum response length (Default: 1024). Limits the number of tokens (roughly 4 characters per token) in the model's response. Increase for longer outputs, decrease to control costs, and response size.
    

## **Supported Model Variants:**

| **Model** | **Input Tokens** | **Optimized For** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo-4K | 4K | Fast responses, most cost-effective option, suitable for shorter queries and simple tasks |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K | 16K | Extended context processing, handling longer documents, cost-effective for medium-length tasks |
| GPT-4-128K | 128K | Maximum context length, advanced reasoning with very large documents, complex multi-step tasks |
| Custom Model | Configurable | Allows users to define custom model settings with API key, tokens, and parameters for specialized applications |

## **Inputs and Outputs**

- #### **Input Channels**
    

**Prompt** – Primary text input for the model. **Questions** – Accepts plain text prompts or user-generated questions, forwarded to the OpenAI model for processing. **Documents** – Document objects for context. **System** – System instructions for the model.

- #### **Output Channels**
    

**Text** – Generated text output. **Answers** – The model-generated response based on the input received. The output is a string of generated text that can be passed to other nodes.

## **Frequently Asked Questions:**

- ### **Authentication Issues**
    

**Invalid API key:** Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly entered and has sufficient permissions **Organization access:** Verify your organization ID if using organization-specific resources

- ### **Request Limitations & Timeouts**
    

**Rate limits:** Implement request throttling or upgrade to a higher tier for more capacity **Timeouts:** Increase the timeout parameter or reduce the complexity of your prompt
