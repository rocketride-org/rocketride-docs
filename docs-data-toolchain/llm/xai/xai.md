The **xAI** **node** allows connection to xAI’s language models for processing natural language questions and generating responses. This node is used to send prompts to a specified model and return text-based answers via token-based authentication.


## **Configuration:**

When setting up the xAI node, you'll need to configure several parameters:

- **Model Selection:** Choose the appropriate xAI model variant based on your needs (e.g., grok-2, grok-3-beta)
- **API Key:** Enter your xAI API key. Remember to store your API key securely and never share it publicly.
- **Available Models:** The xAI node provides access to the latest Grok models, ensuring you can leverage advanced AI capabilities for your workflows.


## **Supported Model Variants:**

| **Model** | **Context Window** | **Optimized For** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grok-2 | 128K tokens | Advanced reasoning, knowledge-based responses, code generation |
| Grok-3-beta | 256K tokens | Enhanced reasoning, complex problem-solving, improved contextual understanding |
| Custom | Model-dependent | User can specify model name based on available xAI models |

## **Key capabilities include:**

- Natural language understanding and generation
- Context-aware reasoning
- Content summarization and transformation
- Conversational AI responses
- Creative content generation

## **Inputs and Outputs**

- ### **Input Channels:**
    

**Prompt** – Primary text input for the model. **Questions** – Accepts plain text prompts or user-generated questions, forwarded to the xAI model for processing. **Documents** – Document objects for context (if supported by your xAI integration). **System** – System instructions for the model (if supported).

- ### **Output Channels:**
    

**Text** – Generated text output. **Answers** – The model-generated response based on the input received. The output is a string of generated text that can be passed to other nodes.

## **Frequently Asked Questions:**

- #### **Authentication Issues**
    

**Invalid API key:** Ensure XAI\_API\_KEY is properly configured with correct permissions. **Connection problems:** Verify XAI\_API\_URL is accurate and network connectivity is established.

- #### **Request Limitations & Timeouts**
    

**429 Too Many Requests:** Implement an exponential back-off strategy or upgrade your subscription. **Request timeouts:** Consider increasing the timeout parameter or reducing the input size.
