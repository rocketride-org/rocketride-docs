The **Qwen node** (`llm_qwen`) integrates Alibaba's Qwen large language models via the DashScope API. It uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it works with standard chat completion interfaces while connecting to Qwen models hosted by Alibaba Cloud.

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `apikey` | string | Yes | — | DashScope API key (must start with `sk-`) |
| `model` | string | Yes | — | Qwen model identifier |
| `region` | string | No | `us` | Endpoint region: `us`, `intl`, or `cn` |
| `modelTotalTokens` | integer | No | — | Maximum token limit (must be > 0 if set) |

### Regional Endpoints

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| `us` | US DashScope endpoint |
| `intl` | International DashScope endpoint |
| `cn` | China DashScope endpoint |

## Inputs and Outputs

### Input Channels

- **Prompt / Questions** — Text prompts or user-generated questions forwarded to the Qwen model.
- **Documents** — Document objects for additional context.
- **System** — System instructions for the model.

### Output Channels

- **Text / Answers** — The model-generated response text.

## Key Details

- Uses the OpenAI-compatible DashScope API, powered by `langchain_openai` and `openai` packages.
- Temperature is set to `0` for deterministic outputs.
- API key format is validated during configuration (must start with `sk-`).
- Includes retry logic with detection of retryable errors (rate limits, transient failures).

## Common Use Cases

- **Multilingual workflows** — Qwen models have strong multilingual capabilities, especially for Chinese and English tasks.
- **Cost-effective inference** — Access competitive LLM performance through Alibaba's DashScope platform.
- **Regional compliance** — Choose between US, international, or China endpoints to meet data residency requirements.
