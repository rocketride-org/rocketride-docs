The Data–Reducto node utilizes Reducto AI to perform high-quality OCR and parsing on documents, extracting clean text and well-structured tables.


## **Input**

- Data: Accepts a wide range of file or content types, including binary files, mixed media, or serialized formats

## **Outputs**

- Text: Outputs extracted text as markdown‑formatted content, preserving headings, lists, and paragraphs where available
- Table: Outputs structured tables extracted from the document (markdown table format)

## **How to Use**

1. Connect a data source to the Data input (example files from the File System, emails, documents)
2. Provide your Reducto API Key in the node configuration
3. Choose a configuration mode:
    - Simple Mode - Quickly enable parsing options for handwritten text, multilingual documents, or AI-driven summarization
    - Advanced Mode - Unlock full control over Reducto API parameters by supplying Python dictionaries in the provided fields. This allows fine-tuned parsing behavior beyond the simple options.
4. Use the appropriate output ports (Text and/or Tables) to route the parsed results downstream

## **Configuration**

- API Key (required): Your Reducto API key
- Simple Mode Options:
    - Contains Handwritten Text – Enables Agentic OCR mode for better handwriting recognition and small text/table cell corrections.
    - Contains Non-English Text – Enables Multilingual OCR system which can parse non-Germanic languages and unicode symbols.
    - Enable AI Summarization – Generate a text summary of both tables and figures within your document using AI.
- Advanced Mode:
    - Provides full access to all Reducto API parameters
    - Enter Python dictionaries into the fields for **Options**, **Advanced Options**, and **Experimental Options** as documented in the [Reducto Parsing Configurations Documentation](https://docs.reducto.ai/parsing/default-configurations). This page also contains examples of how to format the options fields.
    - When Advanced Mode is enabled, any configured settings in the Simple Mode will be ignored

### **Notes**

- Markdown outputs: Text and Table outputs are emitted as markdown; tables appear in standard markdown table format
- Multiple outputs: A single document can produce both Text and multiple Table outputs

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

- **What files can I use?** PDFs, images, scanned documents, emails, and other file formats.
- **How good is the text recognition?** "Agentic" mode offers the best accuracy at a higher cost. "Standard" mode is more economical.
