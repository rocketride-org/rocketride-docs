## **What does it do?**

The **Audio - Transcribe** node converts audio or video files into text using advanced speech-to-text models. It provides options to fine-tune silence detection, chunking, and model selection, making it ideal for transcribing interviews, meetings, lectures, or any spoken content.

## **How do I use it?**

To use the **Audio - Transcribe** node in your workflow:

1. **Add the Audio - Transcribe node**
    - Insert the node into your pipeline where you want to transcribe audio or video files
2. **Connect Input**
    - Connect the input lane (usually audio or video) to your audio or video source
3. **Configure Parameters**
    - Adjust the transcription model, silence detection, chunking, and VAD level as needed (see tables below)
4. **Connect Output**
    - The node outputs the transcribed text for further processing, analysis, or storage

## **Configuration Parameters**

Customize the transcription process with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Effect/Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model** | The Whisper model to use for transcription (see model options below) | Controls speed and accuracy of transcription; larger models are slower but more accurate |
| **Silence Threshold** | The silence threshold (in seconds) to detect silence in speech | Lower values are more sensitive to silence; higher values may treat more as speech |
| **Minimum Seconds** | The minimum seconds of audio to process in a batch and to look for silence | Controls the minimum chunk size for processing |
| **Maximum Seconds** | The maximum seconds of audio to buffer and process at once | Controls the maximum chunk size for processing |
| **VAD Level** | Voice Activity Detection (VAD) level for silence detection (see VAD options below) | Controls how aggressively the system filters out non-speech and background noise |

* * *

## **Model Options**

Choose the Whisper model that best balances speed and accuracy for your needs:

| Option | Description | Performance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **tiny** | Fastest, least accurate | Quickest processing, basic accuracy |
| **base** | Fast, low accuracy | Good speed, improved accuracy |
| **small** | Medium speed and accuracy | Balanced performance |
| **medium** | Slower, high accuracy | Better accuracy, longer processing |
| **large** | Slowest, highest accuracy | Best accuracy, longest processing time |

## **VAD Level Options**

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) controls how the system distinguishes speech from silence and noise:

| Option | Description | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Most permissive** | Detects the most audio as speech | Risk: includes noise |
| **Slightly more aggressive** | Skips minor background noise | Filters light background sounds |
| **Balanced** | Moderate filtering of non-speech | Default in many tools |
| **Most aggressive** | Filters aggressively | May cut off quiet or short speech |

## **Example Use Cases**

- Transcribe meeting recordings for searchable notes
- Convert podcasts or interviews into text for analysis
- Generate subtitles or captions for video content
- Create searchable archives of recorded lectures or presentations
- Process customer service calls for quality analysis
- Extract text from voicemails or audio messages
- Prepare audio content for accessibility compliance

## **Best Practices**

- **Model Selection**: Use smaller models for quick drafts, larger models for final transcripts
- **Audio Quality**: Higher quality audio produces better transcription results
- **Chunking**: Adjust minimum/maximum seconds based on your content type (shorter for conversational, longer for lectures)
- **VAD Tuning**: Start with balanced VAD and adjust based on your audio environment

* * *

**In summary:**

The Audio - Transcribe node provides flexible, high-quality speech-to-text transcription for audio and video files, with customizable options for model selection, silence detection, chunking, and VAD level to fit a wide range of transcription needs.
