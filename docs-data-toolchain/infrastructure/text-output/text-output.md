The **Text Output node** (`text_output`) writes processed text to SMB/CIFS network file shares. It acts as a sink node — it receives text from upstream nodes and writes it to a configured network path. Use this when your pipeline needs to output results to a shared network drive.

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `server` | string | Yes | SMB/network server path |
| `targetObjectPath` | string | Yes | Network output file path pattern |

## Inputs and Outputs

### Input Channels

- **Text** (`writeText`) — Text content to accumulate and write.

### Output Channels

None — this is a sink node. Text is written to the configured network share.

## Key Details

- Outputs to SMB/CIFS network shares (Windows file sharing protocol).
- Appends `.txt` extension to all output files.
- Maintains the directory structure from source documents.
- All files are written with UTF-8 encoding.
- Caches directory creation to avoid repeated SMB calls.
- Skips empty files (only writes when text has been accumulated).
- Tracks transformation keys (mtime + size) for incremental processing.
- Dependencies: `smbclient`, `smbprotocol`.

## Common Use Cases

- **Document export** — Write processed or summarized text to a shared network drive for team access.
- **ETL pipelines** — Output extracted and transformed text to network storage as part of a data pipeline.
- **Archival** — Store pipeline output on network-attached storage for long-term retention.
