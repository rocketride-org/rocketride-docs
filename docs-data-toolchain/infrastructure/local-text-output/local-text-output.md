The **Local Text Output node** (`local_text_output`) writes processed text to the local filesystem. It acts as a sink node — it receives text from upstream nodes and saves it as `.txt` files in a configured directory. Use this when your pipeline needs to output results to the local machine rather than a network share.

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `storePath` | string | Yes | — | Local output directory path |
| `exclude` | string | No | `N/A` | Path prefix to exclude/relativize from source paths |

The `exclude` field strips a prefix from source file paths to create cleaner relative output paths. When set to `N/A` or omitted, absolute source paths are used.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Input Channels

- **Text** (`writeText`) — Text content to write.

### Output Channels

None — this is a sink node. Text is written to the local filesystem.

## Key Details

- Converts the original source file extension to `.txt` on output.
- Creates the directory structure matching source paths automatically.
- All files are written with UTF-8 encoding.
- Directories are created with `os.makedirs(exist_ok=True)`.
- Skips writes if no text has been accumulated for a file.
- Logs warnings for path mismatches and I/O errors.

## Common Use Cases

- **Local document export** — Save processed or extracted text to the local filesystem for review.
- **Development and testing** — Output pipeline results locally during development without needing network infrastructure.
- **Text extraction** — Convert documents from various formats to plain text files on disk.
